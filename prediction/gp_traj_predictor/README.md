# Gaussian Process Regression Opponent Trajectory Prediction
This system extends the planner and state machine for autonomous racing by integrating Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) to predict opponent vehicle trajectories. By collecting the opponent's state data over a full lap, the system builds a predictive model to anticipate future movements, enabling more strategic and collision-aware planning. The original reference algorithm is based on the [Predictive Spliner](https://github.com/ForzaETH/predictive-spliner) developed by the ForzaETH team.

## Key Features
- **Opponent Trajectory Prediction with GPR:** Collects opponent state data (position, velocity) throughout a full lap and uses GPR to predict the opponent's trajectory over a future time horizon.
- **Planner & State Machine Integration:** The predicted trajectory is incorporated into the planner and state machine to generate racing lines that strategically account for the opponent's future positions.
- **Uncertainty-Aware:** GPR provides both mean predictions and uncertainty (variance), allowing for risk-sensitive planning (e.g., expanding safety margins).

## Nodes
Started by `3d_headtohead.launch` and `3d_headtohead_fbga.launch` (`enable_prediction:=true`):
- `3d_opponent_trajectory.py`: collects the opponent's states over a lap.
- `gaussian_process_opp_traj.py`: fits the GP opponent trajectory (`/opponent_trajectory`).
- `predictor_opponent_trajectory.py`: updates the trajectory with new observations.
- `3d_opp_prediction.py`: propagates the observed opponent along the trajectory (`/opponent_prediction/obstacles`).
- `dynamic_prediction_server.py`: dynamic_reconfigure server.

## Dynamic Reconfigurable Parameters
There are several parameters that can be dynamically reconfigured. To do this, launch `rqt` and select `dynamic_prediction_tuner_node`.
A short overview of the reconfigurable parameters:

### GPR Opponent Trajectory Prediction
- `n_time_steps`: Number of time steps for prediction.
- `dt`: Time step for prediction.
- `save_distance_front`:  Length of car in the front plus margin for enable prediction.
- `max_expire_counter`: Maximum n of iterations until prediction info gets deleted.
- `update_waypoints`: Update waypoints.
- `speed_offset`: Add speed offset.
